              <p>
                I&rsquo;m a multidisciplinary creative technologist with a
                passion for fashion. With a strong foundation in wearables and
                software development, I&apos;ve worked on projects like
                AI-powered smart glasses for language learning and a
                next-generation fashion platform.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                My journey spans from creating arts to making engineering
                prototypesâ€”such as a fiber optic headdress and air mouse gloves.
                As both a designer and a coder, I specialize in leveraging
                Javascript, Python, and UX/UI frameworks to build intuitive,
                impactful user experiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also bring experience and connections from renowned
                organizations like Chanel and Parsons School of Design, where I
                honed my skills in business strategy, marketing research, and
                problem-solving. From Chengdu to New York to Paris, I thrive in
                fast-paced, innovative environments and aim to build the future
                by merging fashion and technology.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>Welcome to my journey.</p>
