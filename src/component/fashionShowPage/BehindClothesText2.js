                The fact is, the society still has malignity against women.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Even when one is raped, people tend to blame the victim
                <br/>
                <br/>
                rather than perpetrator. However, in Belgium, poeple set up a
                <br/>
                <br/>
                museum to exhibit the clothes of victims in rape cases.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Checking them out, you would find the clothes are not "sexy".
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In addition, rapists are usually acquaintances, not strangers.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                What's more, the conditions with high rape rates are the
                <br/>
                <br/>
                ones that women are more "conservative" in dressing. In 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                contrast, those areas with nude beaches are the ones with
                <br/>
                <br/>
                lower rape rates. Sex is not dirty and Life is not a porn.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                So, the show try to call for equality, justice, and tolerance for all.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Don't treat others differently just because of their sex, or
                <br/>
                <br/>
                anything else. That is essentially the message of feminism.
